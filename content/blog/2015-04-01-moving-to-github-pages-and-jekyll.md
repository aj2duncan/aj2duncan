title:  "Moving to Github Pages and Jekyll"

I started this website out on wordpress.com and then moved it to a server where I was paying too much money and not getting what I wanted. 

Recently I've started using [git][git] as part of my research work and therefore heard about [GitHub][github] and finally about [GitHub Pages][github-pages]. 

So long story short I have moved my website to [Github Pages][github-pages] and used [Jekyll][jekyll] to make blogging easier. Hopefully this will mean more posts and more pages for my students. 

I won't bore you with details at present but will hopefully put something together documenting how I did it, as much for my benefit as for anyone else's.

[jekyll]:       http://jekyllrb.com
[github]:       https://github.com
[git]:          http://git-scm.com
[github-pages]: https://pages.github.com

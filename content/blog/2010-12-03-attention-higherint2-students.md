<p>I would like to point the attention of my students to the <a title="Mathcentre" href="http://www.mathcentre.ac.uk" target="_blank">Mathcentre</a> link (in the links section to the right). Lots of free problems and notes. Click and investigate.</p>
<p>Also you should all have a wee look at <a title="The Joy of Stats" href="http://preview.tinyurl.com/2vyt2hy" target="_blank">this</a><strong> </strong>very cool way to display statistical information.</p>

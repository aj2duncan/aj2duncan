<p>The topic of changing the base of a logarithm came up in class the other day and whilst it isn’t actually part of the Higher maths course, I thought it was worth a short post.</p>
<div id="a-numerical-example" class="section level2">
<h2>A numerical example</h2>
<p>Let’s suppose that our calculator only has functions for <span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}(x)\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(\ln(x)\)</span> but we are asked to calculate <span class="math inline">\(\log_5(12)\)</span>. Well suppose we let <span class="math display">\[y = \log_5(12)\]</span> then we have that <span class="math display">\[5^y = 12.\]</span> Now we can take <span class="math inline">\(\log_{10}\)</span> of both sides</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\log_{10}(5^y) = \log_{10}(12)\]</span> and bring the power down <span class="math display">\[y\log_{10}(5) = \log_{10}(12)\]</span> allowing us to finally rearrange for <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>: <span class="math display">\[y = \frac{\log_{10}(12)}{\log_{10}(5)}.\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore we have <span class="math display">\[\log_5(12) = \frac{\log_{10}(12)}{\log_{10}(5)}\]</span> which we can calculate.</p>
</div>
<div id="an-algebraic-example" class="section level2">
<h2>An algebraic example</h2>
<p>The same process works in the general case too. Suppose <span class="math display">\[y = \log_a{b}\]</span> then <span class="math display">\[a^y = b\]</span> and we can take logarithm with a different base <span class="math display">\[\log_c(a^y) = \log_c(b)\]</span> move the power down <span class="math display">\[y\log_c(a) = \log_c(b),\]</span> giving us <span class="math display">\[y = \frac{\log_c(b)}{\log_c(a)}.\]</span></p>
<p>Putting all of this together gives us a general rule for changing the base of a logarithm.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\log_a(b) = \frac{\log_c(b)}{\log_c(a)}\]</span></p>
</div>

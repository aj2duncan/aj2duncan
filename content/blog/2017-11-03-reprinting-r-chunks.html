<p>I only discovered this the other day and I’m writing it down so I can find it easily again.</p>
<p>In an R markdown document you can include a <em>chunk</em> or <code>R</code> code like</p>
<pre><code>```{r chunk-name}
my_fn <- function() {
  print("Hello World.")
}
```</code></pre>
<p>What I hadn’t realised is that you can reprint that chunk of code later by using the name as a reference.</p>
<pre><code>```{r, ref.label = "chunk-name", echo = TRUE, results = "markup"}
```</code></pre>
<p>The reason I was looking for this was to enable <code>R</code> functions to be printed in an appendix without having to copy and paste the code.</p>
<p>This also means that you could put a chunk earlier in the document with <code>eval = FALSE</code> and then actually calculate the results later in the document by using <code>ref.label = &quot;chunk-name&quot;, eval = TRUE</code>. I doubt I’ll use this very much but it might be useful at some point.</p>
<p>It is of course in the <a href="https://yihui.name/knitr/demo/reference/">knitr documentation</a> and the functionality is exactly what I’ve come to expect from a package by <a href="https://yihui.name/">Yihui Xie</a>. Yihui thinks of pretty much everything when he writes a package.</p>

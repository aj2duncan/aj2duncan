This will be a post I keep updating as it keeps track of things I keep forgetting

## Git

See a git commit log that is nice and neat, including what stage remotes and branches are at. 

```sh
git log --oneline --decorate
```

Download a git repo from a remote, without the git metadata and unpack it into the current directory. For info on git archive see this [link](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/export-git-archive){target='_blank'}

```sh
git archive --format=tar --remote=git@url:user/repo.git master | tar x
```


## Linux

To compress a folder (create, verbose, compress, files) with full file path

```sh
tar -cvzf folder.tar.gz /path/to/folder
```

To skip the subfolders

```sh
tar -cvzf folder.tar.gz --directory=/path/to folder
```

Then extract them with

```sh
tar -xvf folder.tar.gz
```
To look at the amount of storage that all home directories take up

```sh
sudo du -d 1 -ch /home/
```

## ggplot

To change the angle of labels on an axis

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_boxplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

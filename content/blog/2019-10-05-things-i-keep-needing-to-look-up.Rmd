This will be a post I keep updating as it keeps track of things I keep forgetting

## Git

See a git commit log that is nice and neat, including what stage remotes and branches are at. 

```sh
git log --oneline --decorate
```




## Linux

To compress a folder (create, verbose, compress, files) with full file path

```sh
tar -cvzf folder.tar.gz /path/to/folder
```

To skip the subfolders

```sh
tar -cvzf folder.tar.gz --directory=/path/to folder
```

Then extract them with

```sh
tar -xvf folder.tar.gz
```

<p>I had an interesting discussion with several students the other day about whether numbers exist. My argument was that numbers themselves don’t exist, they are a concept. They only exist once they are attached to objects.</p>
<p>This led me to think about one of my other courses where we discuss the history of Risk. One of the things I mention there is that the concept of zero, which appeared after other numbers. <em>People didn’t have zero animals, they had some animals.</em> However, without it (and the ability to write numbers down as we do now) then the mathematics we do today <em>not to mention our digital world</em> wouldn’t function quite as well.</p>
<p>I thought this <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/history-of-zero/">article</a> presented quite a nice brief history of zero but other course quick google search will bring up others.</p>

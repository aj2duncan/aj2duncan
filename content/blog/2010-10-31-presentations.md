<p>I've done a couple of presentations to classes so far and I did another this week. The facilities I've got aren't amazing but I should probably use them better than I do. </p>
<p>The students seem to quite like short presentations as its different from me standing at the whiteboard doing examples. Problem I had this week was that the font size on the plots I used wasn't big enough and I didn't discover this until after I'd put it on the wall. </p>
<p>However, I'd learnt from last time (when the projector didn't work) and had handouts for everyone too. The plots came out fine on the handouts, just not when blown up. </p>
<p>Need to check beforehand.</p>

I spend most of my time programming in [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). This includes teaching and research. Teaching with **R** includes an *Introduction to R* course, a level 6 [Statistics](https://www.sqa.org.uk/sqa/73224.html) and a third year degree module. For my research I spend a large amount of time cleaning, organising and analysing data. Recently I have also been building [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) apps either as online resources and to automate reporting.

### Shiny

Aside from internal Shiny apps I have built two Shiny servers. Both run off RStudio's open source [Shiny server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/). 

- The [Online Epidemiology resource centre](http://epidemiology.sruc.ac.uk) which I built as part of my work with the  [Epi Unit](http://www.sruc.ac.uk/info/120249/epidemiology_research_unit). It hosts a number of online models and calculators, all available publically.  
- My own [shiny server](https://shiny.aj2duncan.com/) to use for any apps I develop for teaching or just for my own interest.

### Package Development

I have developed a package for the Epi Unit, a package for a third year degree module and I have forked a version of [thesisdown](https://github.com/ismayc/thesisdown) specifically for the River and Lochs Institute - [thesisdownrli](https://aj2duncan.github.io/thesisdownrli/).  

### Web Design

I have also been toying with [d3](https://d3js.org/) and have used it to produce some preliminary results from a [Lyme disease project](https://epidemiology.sruc.ac.uk/projects/lyme_disease_risk/results). I have also done a small amount of web design (aside from the this site) and built [Strandings.org](http://www.strandings.org) is the website of the marine stranding scheme scotland and something I have been working with for a few years. This website has details of strandings (once they have been confirmed and/or post mortemed) and they can be mapped or basic statistical charts shown.

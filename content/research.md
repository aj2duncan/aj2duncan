### Current Research

I am currently working with the [SRUC Epidemiology Research Unit](http://www.sruc.ac.uk/info/120249/epidemiology_research_unit) and across several research groups at Inverness College UHI. At the SRUC I mainly work on network analysis of animal movements, automating disease reporting and building online applications. I also do a little bit of website design and work a lot with the statistical software [R](http://cran.r-project.org/). For full details please see the [software](https://aj2duncan.com/software/) page.

I was sat on a train for a little over 3 hours today and managed to get something finished that I've been working on for a couple of days. 

The [new shiny app][new_app] is something I've put together as an example of what might be possible for the [RLI][rli] to show off. It has also given me a chance to use the [plotly][plotly] R package for the first time - I think I'll be using it again! It is very easy to use and as I use [ggplot2][ggplot] so much - it seems to be a quick way to get tooltips etc in [shiny][shiny] apps. 

For info the new app calculate rod catch statistics and allows users to choose the species, years and rivers they'd like to examine the results for.

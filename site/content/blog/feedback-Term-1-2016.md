As with [last year][feedback_post], I started the feedback gathering process by putting up 4 things I wanted feedback on up on the whiteboard and then left the room. I will follow this up with a [Socrative][socrative] quiz to collect individual feedback.

Anyway here are the questions and the feedback. Any comments of mine are in _italics_.

__What's good?__

- Explanation when needed.
- Great deaf awareness.
- Approachable.

__What needs improved?__

- Class interaction. 

__More of ...__

- Quadratic Inequalities.
- More examples/questions that are cross topic.

__Less of ...__

- Maths. _I did mention this might be difficult_

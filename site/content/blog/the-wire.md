<p>A friend of mine put me onto <a href="https://youtu.be/O1mmePD549o" target="blank_">this</a>. I've watched The Wire a bit but haven't got far enough into it to appreciate this bit. I guess the point of this clip is to show that if we can teach using examples that the learners can understand and relate to (or not even realise that they're learning) then we are more likely to get through to them.</p>
<p>Please excuse the language</p>

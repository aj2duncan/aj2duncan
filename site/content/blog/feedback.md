In the past I have collected feedback using forms of one kind or another, including those that I've designed myself. I never really felt like I got accurate feedback. 

However, last year I tried something out with one of my classes and got a better response. I put some questions up on the board and left the room asking my class to answer the questions. I did something similar last week with my Higher Maths class and I will double check how many agreed with the feedback using [Socrative][socrative]. Socrative is quite nice because I can collect the responses anonymously and save all the results for later.

Anyway here are the questions and the feedback. Any comments of mine are in _italics_.

__What's good?__

- Level/degree of explanation concerning topics

__What needs to be improved?__

- Contact details for out of class hours. Email questions. _(I have added these to our online learning environment)_
- The quality of drawing straight lines. 

__What would you like more of?__

- Exam question walkthroughs.
- More homework, specific for topics.

__Less of?__

- N/A

__General comments?__

- Good work Andrew, keep it up. (Genuine not sarcastic)

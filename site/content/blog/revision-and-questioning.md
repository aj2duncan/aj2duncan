<p>Sorry, haven't posted in a while. I'll try to get back to more regular updates.</p>
<p>Last week, my classes had some NABs to do and so the topic of revision came up. In a lot of cases people revised well and if they didn't pass a section there was an explanation for it. They could do examples in class fine but forgot a formula. They were off the day we taught that formula and missed the catch-up class. They just got a little confused but have demonstrated to me in class that they know what they are doing - with a little more practice they'll be fine.</p>
<p>Then there are the students who I managed to miss. I completely missed the fact they couldn't do a subject. Now the problem isn't that I didn't ask or speak to them about the subject the issue is I didn't ask the right questions. Before the test I made sure that I went round and spoke to everyone to see how they were getting.</p>
<p>The problem is I ask things like "Are you getting on ok?" or "Do you understand?" or "Do you have any questions?"...</p>
<p>These questions are pretty useless. They rely on the student knowing they have a problem and/or being willing enough to own up to it. I need to ask questions that actually check whether the student knows what they are actually doing. Sometimes this might be difficult because I think I'll need to get students to start questions because there are few topics in my classes of which knowledge can be tested by a simple verbal question.</p>

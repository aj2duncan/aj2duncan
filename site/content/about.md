I am currently a mathematics lecturer, researcher and programme coordinator for science, maths and aqua at [Inverness College, UHI](http://www.inverness.uhi.ac.uk)

I have a BSc (Hons) and a PhD in maths from Edinburgh University.

I spend my spare time with my wonderful wife, our new baby girl and our wee dog, riding my bike and curling (you know the sport with granite rocks and ice!).

All views, ideas and documents on this site are my own.

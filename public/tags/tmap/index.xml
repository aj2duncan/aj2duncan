      <description>Recently I have been using the sf and tmap packages a lot and I thought I would come back to finish a draft post I started a while ago.
As part of a project a while ago, I needed to create a square grid across Scotland and produce centroids for each. We start by loading the packages we’ll need and the shapefile.
library(sf)library(tmap)scot &amp;lt;- st_read(&amp;quot;scot_shapefile/scot.shp&amp;quot;)We can see what this looks like with a quick plot.</description>

      <description>The Scottish Government Rural Classification gives definitions of rural areas within Scotland. As someone who lives (and works) in an area classed as rural I’ve taken more interest in this more recently. I’ve also started working with mapping more in R and so decided to combine the two into a post. As part of the classification Scottish Government provide a shape file to download. We can then load it in.</description>

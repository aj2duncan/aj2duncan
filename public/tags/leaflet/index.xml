      <description>Following an earlier [post] where I plotted postcode polygons on a Leaflet map I wanted to update it to use the sf package which is now my default package for working with spatial data. Note that I’ve also started using &amp;lt;- again after being a longtime user of =.
Sorting the DataFirst we’ll load the packages we need.

      <description>A little over a month ago I attended FOSS4GUK 2019. It was a great conference and there were a few presentations (like mine) on Leaflet. One conversation I had was about using Leaflet to gather data and the question was whether it could be used draw and export polygons/polylines. I thought I would see if it could be. I have previously used a shiny app to record points submitted by users but not to record polygons.</description>

      <description>I have been using Leaflet for a little while now but always as part of a shiny app. However, as Mike Spencer went to all the trouble of producing polygons for GB postcode areas and districts I thought this was a good opportunity for a blog post (Spencer 2018).

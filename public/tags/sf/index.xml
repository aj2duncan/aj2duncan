      <description>Recently I have been using the sf and tmap packages a lot and I thought I would come back to finish a draft post I started a while ago.
As part of a project a while ago, I needed to create a square grid across Scotland and produce centroids for each. We start by loading the packages we’ll need and the shapefile.
library(sf)library(tmap)scot &amp;lt;- st_read(&amp;quot;scot_shapefile/scot.shp&amp;quot;)We can see what this looks like with a quick plot.</description>

      <description>Following an earlier post where I plotted postcode polygons on a Leaflet map I wanted to update it to use the sf package which is now my default package for working with spatial data. Note that I’ve also started using &amp;lt;- again after being a longtime user of =.
Sorting the DataFirst we’ll load the packages we need.
library(sf)library(leaflet)library(tidyverse)Next we read in the data.</description>

      <description>I have been building Shiny apps in R for what seems like a long time. Recently, I’ve been dabbling with Shiny for Python and for one particular reason. With Shinylive these apps can be hosted without the need for a dedicated server - they just run in the web browser. For me this opens up two interesting possibilities. Firstly, it should mean I can embed an app in this blog (more on this below) and secondly, I can create apps for others and they won’t need to use a Shiny server (or similar) setup to run them.</description>

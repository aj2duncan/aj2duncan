      <description>I’m a little late to the party on this but I thought that I would add a post about it because it is something that relates to my teaching and I was slightly surprised by the conclusion I ended up coming to. The topic is piping and the strengths and weaknesses of the magrittr pipe %&amp;gt;% versus the (relatively) new base pipe |&amp;gt;.
The background to this post is that I was making a general move towards switching from %&amp;gt;% to |&amp;gt;.</description>

      <description>Today I rewrote some old code and came across something that I thought I would write down because I’m pretty sure I’ll forget it if I don’t! The issue was passing strings to the rename() function from the dplyr package to rename a column. This came about because of a change in a older1 version of dplyr which had functions specifically for use inside your own functions. These had an underscore as a postfix.</description>

      <description>Today I rewrote some old code and came across something that I thought I would write down because I’m pretty sure I’ll forget it if I don’t! The issue was passing strings to the rename() function from the dplyr package to rename a column. This came about because of a change in a older1 version of dplyr which had functions specifically for use inside your own functions. These had an underscore as a postfix.</description>

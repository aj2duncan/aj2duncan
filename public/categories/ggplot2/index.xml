      <description>I was playing around with extracting data from ggplot graphs, which I have done previously using ggplot2_build(). This time it was getting some of the modelling results that are plotted using geom_smooth(). Take the quick example below.
library(ggplot2)p = ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &amp;quot;loess&amp;quot;)pThe plot has two layers and so ggplot_build(p)$data will return a list of two data frames.</description>

      <description>I have been a big fan of Hadley Wickhamâ€™s ggplot package for a while. This last week I was building a shiny app and wanted to find out exactly which colours were being used in the plot. After a bit of googling I ended up at this stackoverflow post, which led me to the ggplot_build function which I found seriously useful.
A little demo:
library(ggplot2)# create a sample plotp = ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, colour = factor(cyl), shape = factor(am))) +geom_point(size = 3) +labs(colour = &amp;quot;No.</description>

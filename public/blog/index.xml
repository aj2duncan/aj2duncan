      <title>Using `dplyr::rename()` within a function</title>

      <description>Today I rewrote some old code and came across something that I thought I would write down because I’m pretty sure I’ll forget it if I don’t! The issue was passing strings to the rename() function from the dplyr package to rename a column. This came about because of a change in a older1 version of dplyr which had functions specifically for use inside your own functions. These had an underscore as a postfix.</description>

      <description>Despite knowing that R markdown (through the amazing Pandoc) can create Powerpoint presentations I haven’t used it until very recently. In doing so I thought I would write a quick demo and show what the default slides look like.
We’ll talk about customisation and the end but let’s start with the defaults and demo some things you can do. Most of the code included is the in the template document.</description>

      <description>This is both a follow up post to my earlier post tibbles, data frames and vectors and a query that came up at work.
The central question was how can you extract a column from a tibble as part of a pipe. That might sound straight forward but let’s take a look.
# load packages and create a tibble to work withlibrary(tibble)library(dplyr)test = tibble(id = c(&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;), val = c(1, 2, 3))test# A tibble: 3 x 2id val&amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;lt;dbl&amp;gt;1 a 12 b 23 a 3Let’s run a quick filter() and then select() the values.</description>

      <description>This is a quick guide to hosting xaringan slides online using github pages.
To start with I create an RStudio project (initialising a git repository) and then slides.Rmd using the xaringan R markdown template. At this point we could modify the R markdown file but I&amp;rsquo;m going to make sure it works online first.
Having created slides.html by knitting the R markdown file, we can commit everything we&amp;rsquo;ve got.

      <description>A little over a month ago I attended FOSS4GUK 2019. It was a great conference and there were a few presentations (like mine) on Leaflet. One conversation I had was about using Leaflet to gather data and the question was whether it could be used draw and export polygons/polylines. I thought I would see if it could be. I have previously used a shiny app to record points submitted by users but not to record polygons.</description>

      <description>I learned something new today and the reason I write this is that I’m somewhat confused as to how I didn’t know it already.
Data FramesLet us start by creating a data frame.
temp = data.frame(x = c(1:3), y = c(10:12))temp x y1 1 102 2 113 3 12We can select rows
temp[1,] x y1 1 10and columns
temp$x[1] 1 2 3temp[,2][1] 10 11 12What I hadn’t realised before is that there is another way to select columns, using [[ notation that I’m used to using with lists.</description>

      <description>The Scottish Government Rural Classification gives definitions of rural areas within Scotland. As someone who lives (and works) in an area classed as rural I’ve taken more interest in this more recently. I’ve also started working with mapping more in R and so decided to combine the two into a post. As part of the classification Scottish Government provide a shape file to download. We can then load it in.</description>

      <description>The topic of changing the base of a logarithm came up in class the other day and whilst it isn’t actually part of the Higher maths course, I thought it was worth a short post.
A numerical exampleLet’s suppose that our calculator only has functions for \(\log_{10}(x)\) or \(\ln(x)\) but we are asked to calculate \(\log_5(12)\). Well suppose we let \[y = \log_5(12)\] then we have that \[5^y = 12.</description>

      <description>I have been using Leaflet for a little while now but always as part of a shiny app. However, as Mike Spencer went to all the trouble of producing polygons for GB postcode areas and districts I thought this was a good opportunity for a blog post (Spencer 2018).
Sorting the DataFirst we’ll load the packages we need.

      <description>I’m writing this down in the hope that it will remind me in the future.
Although I have used a minimal reproducible example before, I found one particularly useful the other day.
The ProblemI had developed a shiny app and part of this was a leaflet map where users are able to click the map to add a marker, these are later captured. However, the markers always appeared below and to the right of where the point clicked.</description>

      <description>One of the courses I teach is a degree module which includes an introduction to solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs) numerically using R. I make heavy use of the deSolve package and normally plot results with ggplot2 but one of the models we look at is a 2/3 body problem and we generate results in 3d. At the moment we’ve been using scatterplot3d as it’s pretty easy to use but it is kind of lacking something when it comes to helping students see what is happening.</description>

      <description>I was playing around with extracting data from ggplot graphs, which I have done previously using ggplot2_build(). This time it was getting some of the modelling results that are plotted using geom_smooth(). Take the quick example below.
library(ggplot2)p = ggplot(cars, aes(x = speed, y = dist)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = &amp;quot;loess&amp;quot;)pThe plot has two layers and so ggplot_build(p)$data will return a list of two data frames.</description>

      <description>Since getting my PhD, my mathematics focus has been on network analysis with an emphasis on examining the network with an eye to how diseases might spread through it. I recently came across a new package for network visualisation which I liked because it was interactive without needing to build it into a shiny app. This is similar to several other packages but I liked the syntax of it and that it also seemed quite light weight.</description>

      <description>The other day in the office we were discussing methods of explaining how to change the subject of a formula, our different approaches and any alternatives we have. One difficulty that students can have is the order in which to rearrange and one of my colleagues demonstrated the onion method which I think might help some students. Below I outline how the method works with a few of examples.</description>

      <description>I only discovered this the other day and I’m writing it down so I can find it easily again.
In an R markdown document you can include a chunk or R code like
```{r chunk-name}my_fn What I hadn’t realised is that you can reprint that chunk of code later by using the name as a reference.
```{r, ref.label = &#34;chunk-name&#34;, echo = TRUE, results = &#34;markup&#34;}```The reason I was looking for this was to enable R functions to be printed in an appendix without having to copy and paste the code.</description>

      <description>I had an interesting discussion with several students the other day about whether numbers exist. My argument was that numbers themselves don’t exist, they are a concept. They only exist once they are attached to objects.
This led me to think about one of my other courses where we discuss the history of Risk. One of the things I mention there is that the concept of zero, which appeared after other numbers.</description>

Giving Feedback to StudentsAs I mentioned in my earlier post I started out looking for readings on getting feedback from students and along the way I found some about giving feedback back to students. This article was the piece that I foud most interesting.</description>

      <description>I’ve posted about the feedback I’ve asked for (and received) from students a few times before and the topic is frequently discussed in the workroom.
After collecting the most recent set of feedback I took some time to reflect on the way I collect feedback from the students. As I normally do I spent some time searching for and reading published research/academic blog posts. A lot of the articles I found were about giving feedback to students after assessments and exams, rather than getting feedback from students.</description>

      <description>As with previous years, I collected feedback at the end of the first term of teaching by putting up four questions I wanted answered on up on the whiteboard and then leaving the room. I will follow this up with a Socrative quiz to double check these things and collect any individual feedback, in case someone didn’t want to speak up in class.

      <description>I’m wrting this down because it’s a problem I’ve tried to deal with twice in the last couple of weeks and I had to look the solution up both times. The second time, rather than just fix it I dug a little deeper to find out why something I thought would work didn’t.
Any way, the problem:
library(ggplot2)fake_data &amp;lt;- data.frame(var1 = c(&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;b&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;c&amp;quot;), var2 = c(&amp;quot;x&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;x&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;x&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;y&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;x&amp;quot;))fake_data  var1 var21 a x2 a x3 a y4 b x5 b y6 b y7 c xggplot(fake_data, aes(x = var1, fill = var2)) +geom_bar(position = &amp;quot;dodge&amp;quot;)Now that all works fine but I don’t want the bar for c to be full width, just half width as the others are, so the missing data (or count of zero is clearer).</description>

The new shiny app is something I&amp;rsquo;ve put together as an example of what might be possible for the RLI to show off. It has also given me a chance to use the plotly R package for the first time - I think I&amp;rsquo;ll be using it again!</description>

      <description>I have been a big fan of Hadley Wickham’s ggplot package for a while. This last week I was building a shiny app and wanted to find out exactly which colours were being used in the plot. After a bit of googling I ended up at this stackoverflow post, which led me to the ggplot_build function which I found seriously useful.
A little demo:
library(ggplot2)# create a sample plotp = ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = hp, y = mpg, colour = factor(cyl), shape = factor(am))) +geom_point(size = 3) +labs(colour = &amp;quot;No.</description>

Firstly, this whole website is built using Jekyll which means that I need each of my blog posts to start with the date and then the title. For instance this blog post came from a file named 2016-08-26-Testing-Rmd-to-md-using-knitr.</description>

      <description>I have been using Git and Github for a little while and I think both of them are great. However, there are a few Git projects that I either don&amp;rsquo;t want to put on Github or can&amp;rsquo;t but I want to work on them on multiple computers. I might also add that I don&amp;rsquo;t (at the moment) want to pay for private repositories and instead of using an alternative online service I found out I could use Dropbox.</description>

      <description>In my Higher Maths class we have just finished the recurrence relations topic and as part of that we investigated the limit of recurrence relations. We also plotted some example as \(n \rightarrow \infty\) so we could see the behaviour of \(u_n\). I actually wrote a Shiny app to show the behaviour. The graphs led to a question about the relationship between \(u_n\) as \(n\) increases and exponential functions.</description>

      <description>In the past I have collected feedback using forms of one kind or another, including those that I&amp;rsquo;ve designed myself. I never really felt like I got accurate feedback.
However, last year I tried something out with one of my classes and got a better response. I put some questions up on the board and left the room asking my class to answer the questions. I did something similar last week with my Higher Maths class and I will double check how many agreed with the feedback using Socrative.</description>

Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve started using git as part of my research work and therefore heard about GitHub and finally about GitHub Pages.
So long story short I have moved my website to Github Pages and used Jekyll to make blogging easier. Hopefully this will mean more posts and more pages for my students.</description>
